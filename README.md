Asset Display-er

README 
Asset Display-er is a web app which alows users to choose five cryptocurrency assets (bitcoin, ethereum, avalanche, solana and chainlink) and display information about any of those assets. When an asset is chosen via button clicking, a card is displayed that shows a logo for that currency, its name, and it's latest price. 

When the cards have been displayed, the card has a delete button which hides the card and reactivates its display button.
