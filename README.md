Asset Display-er

README 
Asset Display-er is a web app which alows users to choose from five cryptocurrency assets (bitcoin, ethereum, avalanche, solana and chainlink). When an asset is chosen via button clicking, a card is displayed that shows a logo for that currency, its name, and also it's latest price. 

once the cards have been displayd, the card also has a delete button which removes the card and reactivates its display button.
